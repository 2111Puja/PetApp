Report detailing the purpose of the app, its design considerations and the utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions:

I am writing this report to explain the purpose of an application that I have made, its design considerations and the utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions. 
I have coded and designed an Android application called PetApp, which allows the user to play, feed and clean their virtual pet, while keeping a close eye on the pet’s health, hunger, and cleanliness status. 
This pet application is similar to a virtual pet app or toy called Tamagotchi. My application will have a welcome page that will have a button that says, “Get Started” and once this button is clicked by the user, it will direct the user to the second page where they can feed, clean and play
with their virtual pet. There will also be a “Feed”, “Clean” and “Play” button on the second page that when clicked, it will change the pet’s image to match each action icon, such as feed, clean and play. 
I created the background design of both my welcome screen and second screen using a mobile video template on Canva as well as Picsart, and I edited and customed it to a design that I found appealing and aesthetic. I made the second screen background by myself, so that it is a unique design.  I played around with the graphics and placed them onto the background, as I liked it. I even added a doghouse similar to Snoopy’s doghouse in the background. I decided to do my app on a dog, and I specifically did it on Snoopy. Snoopy is a beagle in the comic strip called Peanuts. He is also in the well-known Peanuts films and television cartoons.
On the second screen of my pet application, I added three different plain texts that says “Hunger”, “Cleanliness” and “Happy”. I have also added three different buttons which include “Feed”, “Clean” and “Play”. The edit text also will display a number for the hunger, cleanliness and happiness status of the pet dog. Depending on which button the user clicks, some of the numbers for either “Hunger, “Cleanliness” or “Happy” will then change. You will also notice that as you click on each of the actions or buttons, the images will start to change or swop according to the action that the button says. 
 
How to use my application:
Step 1: The user will see the welcome screen of my application and they will have to click the “Get Started” button.

Step 2: The second screen of my pet application will open up and the user will have to take care of Snoopy. 

Step 3: They will have to feed, clean and play with Snoopy and as they will do this by clicking on the different buttons on the screen.

Step 4: The user will also have to keep a close eye on Snoopy’s Hunger, Cleanliness and Happiness levels. The different numbers will tell the user all of this information so that their pet can be taken care of.



 
Design:
I will now be discussing my design of the application and the visual elements: For the welcome screen I used an aesthetic Snoopy wallpaper to make the app look eye-catching, especially to a child. For the second screen, I designed and edited the background by myself using Picsart as well as Canva. I even added a doghouse to make it look like Snoopy’s actual house.  I think that my design is pleasing to look at and that it’s visually appealing. I have put a lot of thought into my target audience of this application, which is children.I believe that an app should be fun to look at and should draw the attention of the user as this will make the application more fun to use. The design of my PetApp is simple and has intuitive navigation, which makes it easy to use and understand. The background design is attractive, and the visual elements help to engage the user experience. I have put thought into the accessibility and inclusivity of this application. I ensured that my text sizes are large enough for users to read, that it is legible and that the whole layout of the application is simple and functional, as this boosts user satisfaction. 

GitHub and GitHub actions

GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store and share their code. GitHub is used for version control as well as collaboration in software development projects. GitHub Actions is a feature that enables automatic workflows within the repositories. These workflows allow developers to automate various tasks, such as building and testing. In order to create a repository, you have to first sign into GitHub, then click on ‘Your repository or new.’  Then, add a repository name. The name of your repository should be the name of your Android app. Ensure that the repository is on public and not private. Then, click the green box at the bottom that says, ‘Create repository.’ I also added this text as my readme file on GitHub.

‘Pushing’ a file to GitHub means that you’re uploading a local repository to a remote repository. When you’re doing this, you have to ensure that all of your changes to the local repository are committed. When you commit in GitHub, you create a snapshot of the changes you made in your local repository.
